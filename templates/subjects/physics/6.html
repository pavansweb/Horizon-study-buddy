        <h1>Sound</h1>
        <p>Sound is a form of energy that causes the sensation of hearing. It is produced when a body vibrates, and thus requires a medium for its propagation.</p>
        <p><strong>Audible Range of Frequency:</strong> 20Hz to 20000Hz</p>
        <p><strong>Frequency > 20000 Hz:</strong> Ultrasonic</p>
        <p><strong>Frequency < 20 Hz:</strong> Infrasonic</p>
        <p>The speed of sound is given by the equation: <strong>V = f λ</strong> where <strong>f</strong> is frequency and <strong>λ</strong> is wavelength.</p>
        <p>The frequency of a wave can also be calculated using: <strong>f = 1/T</strong> where <strong>T</strong> is the period.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Mechanical/Elastic Waves</h2>
        <p>When particles of a medium vibrate, there is a change in kinetic energy (K.E.) and vice versa. There are two types of mechanical waves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Longitudinal Wave:</strong> When particles of the medium vibrate along the direction of propagation of the wave, forming compressions and rarefactions. Example: Sound wave in air, solids, and liquids.</li>
            <li><strong>Transverse Wave:</strong> When particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction of propagation, forming crests and troughs. Example: Sound wave in solids, and on the surface of liquids.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Reflection of Sound Waves</h2>
        <p>Sound waves, like any other wave, when striking a hard surface or boundary of another medium, return back to the same medium obeying the laws of reflection:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.</li>
            <li>The incident ray, reflected ray, and normal at the point of incidence all lie in one plane.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The return of a sound wave upon striking a surface such as a wall or metal sheet is called the reflection of sound waves. The reflecting surface must be larger than the wavelength of the sound for reflection to occur.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Echo</h2>
        <p>The sound heard after reflecting from a distant obstacle, such as a cliff or a building, after the original sound has ceased is called an echo.</p>
        <p><strong>Condition for Hearing an Echo:</strong> An echo is only heard if the distance of the person producing sound from the obstacle is far enough to allow the reflected sound to reach the person at least 0.1 seconds after the original sound.</p>
        <p>To hear an echo distinctly, the following conditions must be met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The minimum distance between the sound source and the reflector must be 17 m in air.</li>
            <li>The size of the reflector must be large enough compared to the wavelength of the sound.</li>
            <li>The intensity of the sound should be sufficient for the reflected sound to be audible.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Determining Speed of Sound Using Echo</h2>
        <p>The speed of sound can be determined using the echo method. If the distance from the sound source to the reflector is known, and the time interval for the echo is measured, the speed of sound can be calculated using the formula:</p>
        <p><strong>V = 2d / t</strong>, where <strong>d</strong> is the distance to the reflecting surface and <strong>t</strong> is the time interval between the original sound and the echo.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Uses of Echoes</h2>
        <h3>In Animals</h3>
        <p>Animals like bats, dolphins, and dogs use echoes for navigation and hunting. Bats, for instance, can detect obstacles in the dark by emitting ultrasonic sounds and hearing the returning echoes. This process is known as sound ranging.</p>

        <h3>In SONAR</h3>
        <p>SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) uses echoes to detect obstacles underwater, such as submarines or sunken ships. The time interval between the emission of ultrasonic waves and the receipt of the echo helps to calculate the distance to the object.</p>

        <h3>In Medical Fields</h3>
        <p>In the medical field, ultrasound waves are used for imaging organs, a technique known as ultrasonography. Echo cardiography is used to obtain images of the heart.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Characteristics of Sound</h2>
        <h3>Loudness</h3>
        <p>Loudness is the characteristic of sound that allows us to distinguish between a loud sound and a faint one. It depends on the amplitude of the sound wave.</p>

        <h3>Pitch</h3>
        <p>Pitch refers to the shrillness or flatness of sound. It depends on the frequency of the sound wave. Higher frequency leads to higher pitch, and lower frequency leads to lower pitch.</p>

        <h3>Quality (Timbre)</h3>
        <p>The quality (or timbre) of sound distinguishes between two sounds of the same pitch and loudness. This characteristic depends on the waveform and the presence of overtones or subsidiary frequencies in the sound.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Music vs Noise</h2>
        <p>Sound is categorized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Music:</strong> A pleasant sound produced by regular vibrations, typically ranging between 10 dB to 30 dB.</li>
            <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Unpleasant, irregular sound produced by erratic vibrations, usually above 120 dB.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Resonance: A Special Case of Forced Vibration</h2>
      <p><strong>Resonance</strong> is a phenomenon that occurs when a vibrating system or external force drives a system at its natural frequency, causing the system to oscillate with increasing amplitude. Resonance occurs when the frequency of an externally applied periodic force matches the natural frequency of the system, causing it to vibrate with maximum amplitude.</p>

      <h3>Characteristics of Resonance</h3>
      <p>Resonance occurs when the applied force causes forced vibration in the body, and the frequency of the applied force is exactly equal to the natural frequency of the vibrating body. This leads to an increase in the amplitude of vibration, which can be observed in many physical systems, such as tuning forks, musical instruments, and bridges.</p>

      <h3>Conditions for Resonance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The applied force must be periodic (occurring at regular intervals).</li>
        <li>The frequency of the applied force must be exactly equal to the natural frequency of the vibrating body.</li>
        <li>The vibrating body will experience increasing amplitude as long as the external frequency is matched to the natural frequency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Demonstration of Resonance</h3>
      <h4>Experiment 1: Resonance with Tuning Forks</h4>
      <p>When two tuning forks of the same frequency are placed near each other, and one is struck, the second tuning fork will start vibrating due to resonance. This is because the sound wave produced by the first tuning fork matches the natural frequency of the second fork, causing it to vibrate with increasing amplitude.</p>

      <h4>Experiment 2: Forced and Resonant Vibrations of Pendulums</h4>
      <p>When a pendulum is given a periodic push at its natural frequency, its amplitude increases over time. However, if the push is at a different frequency, the pendulum may not resonate and will instead vibrate with a smaller amplitude.</p>

      <h4>Experiment 3: Resonance in Air Column</h4>
      <p>A vibrating air column can also experience resonance when the frequency of sound waves matches the natural frequency of the air column. This is demonstrated in musical instruments like organ pipes and wind instruments where the length of the air column determines the natural frequency.</p>

      <h3>Examples of Resonance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resonant Vibrations of Pendulums:</strong> A pendulum vibrating at its natural frequency exhibits resonance when external periodic forces match its frequency.</li>
        <li><strong>Resonance in Machine Parts:</strong> Certain mechanical systems, such as engines or turbines, can experience damage or efficiency loss due to resonance when external forces match their natural frequencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Resonance in Musical Instruments:</strong> A stretched string in a musical instrument like a guitar experiences resonance when played, amplifying the sound produced by the vibrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Resonance in Bridges:</strong> A bridge can experience resonance when the frequency of moving vehicles matches the natural frequency of the bridge, potentially causing structural damage. Famous examples include the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse.</li>
        <li><strong>Resonance in Radio and TV Receivers:</strong> Radio receivers use resonance to tune to a specific frequency, enhancing the signal reception.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Importance of Resonance</h3>
      <p>Resonance plays a crucial role in various fields of science and technology, from the design of musical instruments to the safety of structures like bridges. Understanding and controlling resonance is important to prevent damage due to excessive vibration and to harness its power in applications like sound amplification, medical imaging, and more.</p>

      <h3>Resonance in Real-World Applications</h3>
      <p>Resonance is applied in several real-world scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Music:</strong> Musical instruments like violins, pianos, and guitars rely on resonance to amplify sound and produce different pitches.</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge Design:</strong> Engineers must account for resonance in bridge design to avoid catastrophic failure, like the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Radio and Television:</strong> Radio and TV receivers use resonance to tune into specific frequencies and improve signal reception.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Imaging:</strong> Techniques like ultrasound and MRI utilize resonance to create detailed images of the inside of the body.</li>
      </ul>
