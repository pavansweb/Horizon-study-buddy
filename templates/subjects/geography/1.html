    <title>Climate of India</title>

    <h1>Climate of India</h1>
    <p>India has a tropical monsoon type of climate because India lies in the tropical belt and its climate is influenced by the monsoon winds. The main characteristics of this type of climate are relatively high temperatures and dry winters.</p>

    <h2>Regional Variations</h2>
    <p>Example, the climatic conditions of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the north differ from that of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the south; yet all of these States have a similar monsoon type of climate.</p>

    <h2>Precipitation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Snowfall occurs in the Himalayas, whereas it only rains over the rest of the country.</li>
        <li>Cherrapunji and Mawsynram in Meghalaya get about 1100 cm rains in the year, whereas Jaisalmer in Rajasthan hardly receives 9 cm of rainfall in a year.</li>
        <li>Tura in Meghalaya gets an amount of rainfall in a single day which is equal to 10 years of rainfall at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan.</li>
        <li>Most parts of India receive rainfall during June-September, but the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu get rains in the beginning of the winter season.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Temperature</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Barmer in Rajasthan may record a temperature of 48°C or 50°C on a June day, while it hardly reaches 22°C at Pahalgam or Gulmarg in Kashmir on the same day.</li>
        <li>Kerala has tropical climate with warm and moist air, whereas Punjab has continental climate with severe heat alternating with severe cold.</li>
        <li>The temperature touches -40°C in Kargil in the month of December whereas Kerala records 20°C or 22°C in the same month.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Factors Affecting the Climate of India</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>The Himalayas:</b> The Himalayas form a climatic barrier separating the Indian sub-continent from the rest of Asia. They not only prevent the cold Siberian winds from entering the Indian region and from India becoming a cold desert but they also force the moisture laden South West Monsoon winds to shed rainfall in India or else India would be a dry region.</li>
        <li><b>The Monsoon Winds:</b> During summers, the moisture carried by these south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal bring rain to the entire subcontinent. Retreating monsoon brings rain in eastern coastal region. During winter, dry offshore, North-East Monsoon winds blow from high pressure to low pressure region. As they blow over a vast landmass, they are cold and dry. They pick moisture from the Bay of Bengal to bring rain to Tamil Nadu in winters.</li>
        <li><b>Latitude:</b> The Indian subcontinent is divided into two parts by the Tropic of Cancer. The northern portion lies in the temperate zone and the southern portion lies in the tropical zone. South India is warmer than the north and does not have a clear-cut winter season. The northern zone does not have the mid-day Sun almost vertically overhead during any part of the year, while the southern zone has the mid-day Sun almost vertically overhead at least twice every year.</li>
        <li><b>Varied Relief:</b> Relief plays an important role in the climatic conditions of India. The Western Ghats get heavy rainfall on western side because they stand in the way of SW Monsoon winds which come from the Arabian Sea. On the other hand, the Deccan Plateau gets less rainfall as it lies in the rain shadow area of the Western Ghats. In Rajasthan, the Aravali Range is parallel to the direction of the SW Monsoon winds. So it is unable to stop the moisture laden winds. This makes Rajasthan a dry area.</li>
        <li><b>Altitude:</b> There is a decrease of 1°C for every 166 m rise in height, because temperature decreases as you move to higher altitudes. So, the mountains are cooler than the plains. Ex: Ooty has lower temperature than Kochi.</li>
        <li><b>Influence of the Surrounding Areas:</b> Nearness to the sea that these areas have a moderate climate.</li>
        <li><b>Western Disturbances:</b> In the winter season due to the shifting of the pressure belts. These cyclones rising from the Mediterranean Sea bring rain to Northern Plains and snow in Jammu and Kashmir in India.</li>
        <li><b>Jet Streams:</b> Jet streams are cold fast blowing winds that develop in the upper layers of the atmosphere. They influence the climate of India. Westerly jet blows over north while Easterly low over South causing depression. These depressions play a very significant role in the distribution pattern of the monsoon rainfall in the subcontinent. The highest rainfall occurs along the track of these depressions.</li>
        <li><b>Distance from the Sea:</b> Areas in the interiors of India have extreme type of climate or continental climate whereas coastal areas have equable or maritime climate! The effect of land breeze and sea breeze caused by differential rate of heating and cooling of land and sea are responsible for moderate climate in coastal areas.</li>
        <li><b>El-Nino Effect:</b> El-Nino is a warm ocean current which sometimes appears off the coast of Peru in South America during the month of December. It increases the surface temperature of the sea and affects the movement of monsoon winds in the Indian Ocean and causes weak drought-like situation in the Indian sub-continent.</li>
